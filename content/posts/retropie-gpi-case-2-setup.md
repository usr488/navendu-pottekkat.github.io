I was hit with a wave of nostalgia recently and decided to go back and play some of my favorite retro games (instead of buying a PS5). I remembered how much fun I used to have playing these games and wanted to experience that again.

I decided to use a Raspberry Pi, RetroPie, and a GPi CASE 2 to make my own handheld retro gaming device.

This tutorial will walk you through how I set all these up.

Before you move on, make sure you have:

1.  [Raspberry Pi Computer Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000) (Lite version with WiFi recommended)
2.  [GPi CASE 2](https://retroflag.com/gpi_case_2.html)
3.  A Micro SD card (at least 16 GB) and an adapter

I will try to be comprehensive so that you don't have to spend time searching for information elsewhere. I will include [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting) and additional resources to help you along the way. So let's get started!

## Inserting CM4 Into the GPi CASE 2

There is a best way to insert the Pi in the case:

1.  Take off the back cover by removing the five screws in the back
2.  Align the markings on the Pi and the case
3.  Click the Pi into place by applying even pressure

I tried inserting the Pi without removing the back cover, and it wasn't inserted correctly. To ensure that you don't damage anything, follow the abovementioned steps.

## Writing the RetroPie/ Recalbox Image to the SD Card

The easiest way to download and write the RetroPie image is by using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

You can download the Raspberry Pi Imager and open it. Connect your SD card to your computer through the adapter (if needed). You are now ready to write the image.

In the Raspberry Pi Imager, select the operating system. Choose "Emulation and game OS" and then:
1. "RetroPie", and the "RetroPie 4.8 (RPI 4/400)" OS or
2. "Recallbox", and the "Recallbox - Rasperry Pi 4/400" OS. 

{{< figure src="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/retropie-os.png#center" title="Selecting the RetroPie OS" caption="Make sure to choose the RPI 4/400 version" link="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/retropie-os.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

> **Note**: Make sure to choose the one for RPI 4/400 if there is a newer version than 4.8 for RetroPie or 8.1.1 for Recallbox.

Select your SD card from the "Storage" option and click on "Write". It will take some time to download and write the image to your SD card. _Grab a cup of coffee._

## Installing Display Patch and Safe Shutdown
### RetroPie
Since RetroPie defaults output to HDMI, we have to install a patch to transfer the display output to the GPIO pins.

Once you have the RetroPie image written to your SD card, you can install this patch.

[Download the patch from the Retroflag website](https://support.retroflag.com/Products/GPi_Case_2/GPi_Case_2_patch.zip) and extract it on your computer and follow the steps below:

1. From the SD card, make a backup of `config.txt` on your computer. You can revert to this config if you mess things up.
2. Copy the contents of the `GPi_Case2_patch_retropie` folder to the SD card.
3. If you are on Windows, click on `install_patch.bat`, and it will install the patch.
4. If you are on Linux or macOS, copy the contents of the `GPi_Case2_patch_retropie/patch_files` folder to the SD card. The files in the `patch_files/overlays` folder should go in the `overlays` folder on the SD card.

Next, you need to configure safe shutdown. To make our lives easier and not type out the command in the GPi CASE 2, you can create a script.

Create a new file on the SD card named `gpi.sh` and add the following content to the file:

```shell
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroFlag/GPiCase2-Script/main/retropie_install_gpi2.sh" | sudo bash
```
### Recallbox
Since version 8.1.1, it is no longer necessary to install a shutdown or display patch for the GPI CASE 2. The necessary configurations are already included in the Image. If the patch is installed anyway, the OS will not boot!


## Configuring WiFi Credentials

Running the `gpi.sh` script will pull some files from the internet. So, you need to set up WiFi on your GPi CASE 2.

To do this easily, you can create a new file called `wifikeyfile.txt` and add the following:

```
ssid="name of your WiFi (case sensitive)"
psk="your WiFi password"
```

> **Note**: If your Raspberry Pi does not have WiFi, you can see [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/retroflag_gpi/comments/s7xpee/getting_internet_on_gpi_case_2_with_cm4_without/) for workarounds.


## First Boot

With your SD card configured, you can disconnect it from your PC and insert it into your GPi CASE.

Before turning it on, connect it to power to ensure the battery does not die on the first boot.

The first boot will take longer (a couple of minutes at least) than usual. Be patient, and don't worry.

Once it is ready, RetroPie will walk you through some configurations you can follow on the screen.

{{< figure src="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/welcome-retropie.png#center" title="Hello RetroPie!" caption="Follow the instructions on the screen to configure controls" link="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/welcome-retropie.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

## Set Up WiFi

You are not ready to play games yet!

Go to the RetroPie configuration menu from the home screen and scroll down to WiFi.

{{< figure src="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/wifi-retropie.png#center" title="Configure WiFi" caption="For more information on all the configuration options, see the [RetroPie website](https://retropie.org.uk/)" link="/images/retropie-gpi-case-2-setup/wifi-retropie.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

Once you go into the WiFi configuration menu, you will see a message saying that you don't have your WiFi country set.

Select "Yes", and in the following menu, choose your country from "Localisation Options".

You can then save and exit, and RetroPie will prompt you to reboot the device.

Once you reboot the device, you can connect to your WiFi.

Now, if you go to the WiFi configuration menu, you will see an option to "Import WiFi credentials from /boot/wifikeyfile.txt". Select it and wait for some time.

You will see that the WiFi is connected, and you can exit the menu.

## Running the Safe Shutdown Install Script (RetroPie only)

In your RetroPie configuration menu, select "File Manager".

Go back twice to reach the root and navigate to the `/boot` folder. Scroll down, find the `gpi.sh` file, and run it. It will install the safe shutdown scripts, and the Pi will reboot.

To test if the scripts are running, try turning off through the hardware switch, and you will see a shutdown message.

That's it! You are all ready to install some retro games and play. You should be easily able to find ROMs by searching the internet. Some of these are pirated, so sharing the sites is not super legal.

 I'm currently obsessed with Pokemon FireRed. *Gotta catch'em all!*

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
If you frequently see an error message like "failed to find mixer elements!", [see this fix by Alan Pfahler](https://www.fastoe.com/blog/how-to-fix-failed-to-find-mixer-elements).

If you are trying to configure audio and are running into issues, you can [see this thread on the RetroPie forum](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/28732/kernel-5-10-on-board-audio-disabled-or-not-present).

### Boot Issues

#### Back Screen
If your GPI CASE 2 device does not boot up and you only get a black screen but no output on your LCD, you can - if you have a GPI CASE 2 incl. dock (the dock is unfortunately not available separately) - try to get an HDMI output (default output ist HDMI). First boot completely without SD card, then you should get a boot screen with the info about the compute module. If no output appears at all, this can have the following possibilities:
- The compute module is not properly mounted on the board, you should hear a clicking sound on both the rear and the front panel. To be on the safe side, you can also open the case with the 5 screws on the back, unfortunately there are still latches on each side that you have to open carefully so that you can remove the back cover.
- Make sure your battery is charged
- The dock does not seem to be a simple USB hub, but is activated via a switch. Make sure you plug the GPI CASE 2 into the dock correctly. If the dock is plugged in, it is active and you will not get any LCD output (even if no HDMI cable is plugged in, but e.g. only power).

If you get an output over HDMI which says: "Error -110 whilst initializing SD card" or if you don't have a dock and the LCD screen just stays black, try this:
xxxxx
xxxxxx
